# Zero Codegen

Zero Codegen is a tool that generates table and relationship definitions for [Zero](https://zero.rocicorp.dev/)  based
on your existing Postgres database.

DISCLAIMER: DISCLAIMER: Zero Codegen is under heavy development and may not function as expected. I'm currently updating
this project when I encounter issues in my own work.

## How to use

At the moment you need to manually clone the repository to run the tool. I'll publish it to NPM in the near future.

1. Install node modules `yarn install`
2. Create `.env.local` file based on `.env.example` file.
3. Run `yarn start`
